### **Project Overview**
This project involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a customer dataset to derive actionable insights. The focus was on understanding customer demographics, spending behaviors, and purchasing patterns.

---

### **Steps Performed**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Identified and handled missing values.
   - Verified data types for consistency.
   - Removed duplicate records for accurate analysis.

2. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Explored distributions of age, income, and gender using histograms and boxplots.
   - Checked for outliers and skewness in numerical data.
   - Examined spending scores and purchase frequencies.

3. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Analyzed correlations between age, income, and spending patterns using heatmaps.
   - Compared spending behavior across genders with bar charts and violin plots.
   - Identified income vs. purchase frequency trends.

4. **Categorical Analysis:**
   - Grouped and visualized customers by marital status and age ranges.
   - Analyzed patterns in high-spending categories.

5. **Visualizations:**
   - Scatter plots for visual clustering.
   - Heatmaps for correlations.
   - Pie charts for customer segment proportions.
